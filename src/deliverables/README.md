This folder contains four files: `train_psi.ipynb`, `constants.py`, `loss_functions.py` and `helper_functions.py`

Running `train_psi.ipynb` will create a training dataset, train a neural network model with parameters defined in `constants.py`, then run PyMGRIT with the trained model. The parameters used, the model and any generated graphics will be saved in a folder.
To modify neural network parameters, see `constants.py`.
To change the loss function used by the model, see `loss_functions.py`.
